# Egyptian Unit Fraction (Presentation)

Egyptian Unit Fraction is a small Node library for finding unit fractions in an Egyptian way. In the Egyptian fraction approach, we can present any positive rational fraction in a sum of distinct unit fractions.  For example: 
3/11 can be presented in Egyptian fraction and would be equal to: 
1/4 + 1/44. 
For more theoretical information about this interesting approach please refer to "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction".

This package is a presentation layer to what is provided by egyptian-unitfraction package.
