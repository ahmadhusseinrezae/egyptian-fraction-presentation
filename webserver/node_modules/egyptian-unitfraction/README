# Egyptian Unit Fraction

Egyptian Unit Fraction is a small Node library for finding unit fractions in an Egyptian way. In the Egyptian fraction approach, we can present any positive rational fraction in a sum of distinct unit fractions.  For example: 
3/11 can be presented in Egyptian fraction and would be equal to: 
1/4 + 1/44. 
For more theoretical information about this interesting approach please refer to "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction".

## Installation

install with npm: 

```bash
npm install --save egyptian-unitfraction
```

## API
To find unit fractions for any positive rational fraction, you can call bellow function provided with numerator and denominator of your fraction.

```javascript
egyptianUnitFraction(numerator,denominator)
```
The function will return an array of computed fractions. Each item in array will be an object which looks like: 

```javascript
{
    operation: 'describe operation has been done',
    result: { 
		numerator: numerator, 
		denominator: denominator 
	}
}
```


## Usage

```javascript
const { egyptianUnitFraction } = require('egyptian-unitfraction')

 const fractions = egyptianUnitFraction(4,9)
 fractions.map((fraction) => {
     console.log(`${fraction.result.numerator} /  ${fraction.result.denominator}`)
 })
```

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
