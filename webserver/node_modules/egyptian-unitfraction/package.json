  "description": "Egyptian Unit Fraction is a small Node library for finding unit fractions in an Egyptian way. In the Egyptian fraction approach, we can present any positive rational fraction in a sum of distinct unit fractions.  For example:  3/11 can be presented in Egyptian fraction and would be equal to:  1/4 + 1/44.  For more theoretical information about this interesting approach please refer to \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction\".",
